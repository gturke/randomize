program define randomize
version 12.0

/*
* Conduct random assignment of a target population, dividing the recordly evenly across 2 or more groups.
* Optionally re-randomize a given number of times and choose the randomization with the best balance across a set of covariates.
* Also supports blocking.
* 
* Stata version 12 is required due to the p-value matrix on regression results, but CM has a code fix to support version 11.

* CREDITS: Thank you to Debby Kermer for earlier contributions to parts of the algorithm.

/*---------------------------------*
* Example syntax: randomize
 - optional settings:
	AMS: default of 2 would mean 1 treatment, 1 control
	groups(integer) -> number of groups to create of equal size within the assignment variable, default to 2.
	minruns() -> minimum number of randomizations to run, default to 10. If blocks are specified this parameter will be per-block.
	maxruns() -> maximum number of randomizations to run, default to 10. If blocks are specified this parameter will be per-block.
	coeffthreshold() -> minimum p-value for an individual coefficient allowable to accept a given randomization. [may need to rename/rethink if we add mahalanohbis distance support.]
	*AMS: we use z-scores below 2. 
	*AMS: what is a joint p-value?
	jointp() -> minimum joint p-value allowable to accept a given randomization. [may need to rename/rethink if we add mahalanohbis distance support.]
	gen(newvar) -> name of the assignment variable, defaulting to _assignment.
	*AMS: block refers to statistical blocking. pairing/grouping of observations based on their similarity 
	block(varlist) -> list of variables to block on.
	*AMS: this is the random number generator
	seed(integer) -> the random number generator seed to use, which ensures the randomization is deterministically repeatable.
	replace -> specify if the assignment variable can be replaced upon generation. If not, the script will generate an error if the assignment variable already exists.
 - options to potentially add later:	
 	mahalanobis distance support.
 	model(mlogit, mprobit, mahalanobis, etc.) -> algorithm used to assess balance. (Not Supported Yet)
 	nolog -> don't show the re-randomization log.
	TARgets(numlist >0 <=3 integer) -> moments of each covariate to control for, 1 = mean, 2 = variance, 3 = skewness.
	support for maximation customization, e.g. iterations(#) vce(passthru)
	saveseed(varname) if blocking is used, save the randomization seed used within each strata for QC purposes.

NOTES:
How to add this ado file to your Stata search path:
- You can type "sysdir" to see which folders you can put the ado file into for Stata to pick it up.
- Or you can type: adopath + "~/somefolder" to have Stata also search a new folder for .ado programs.

TODO/Thoughts:
- Should sortseed also be a parameter so that it is defaulted?
- Blocking code still nee:q to be tested - may be buggy.
- Convert local variables to tempvars so that we don't pollute the global namespace (for local variables).
- Scale down what should be displayed to the user.
- Do we want the result to also be randomly ordered, or not? Presume yes - useful when a voter contact program does not run through all records (e.g. phones).
- Would we want to save the probability that a record is assigned to a given class across all attempted randomizations? May be useful for randomization inference.
- This is basically bootstrapped randomization - may suggest similar parameters and output strategies. Also should look at MCMC simulation programming.
- Create unit tests to confirm that the randomization algorithm works correctly for a variety of experimental scenarios.
- Allow percentage breakdown between assignment groups (e.g. 70%/20%/10%) but then don't do automatic re-randomization per Lock / Rubin.
- Support cluster randomization directly within the algorithm eventually.
